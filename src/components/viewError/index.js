/*
  A generic error component which will fill the space of any container its placed in.
  It requires a heading and subheading to be used to inform the error about why this error is being shown.
  It receives optional props that can help fix a user's problem or nudge them towards resolution:
  - clearStorage: if this prop is present, we will clear the local storage on the client which will then prompt them to re-login on the next page load.
  - refresh: if this prop is present, we will show a button that the user can click to refresh the view. This will most often be used in conjunction with clearStorage
  - children: the error component can receive any other miscellaneous children in order to customize the error view based on the context it's in
